# Module 10 â€” C# Final Project: Contractor & Subcontractor Console App

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This is the final project for Module 10 in C#.  
Itâ€™s a functional console application that manages subcontractor records and calculates their pay. The goal was to apply object-oriented programming principles like **classes, inheritance, constructors, methods, and properties** while keeping the program simple and easy to use.

The app simulates a subcontractor management tool:
- Tracks contractor details: name, ID number, start date, shift, and hourly pay rate.
- Automatically adds a **3% pay differential** for night shift workers.
- Runs entirely in the console with a clear, menu-driven interface.

  - Contractor name
